{
r 'f1': 'volumemute'
r 'F2': 'volumedown'
r 'f3': 'volumeup'

s 'f8': 'Brightness_Down'
'f':'This is a sample of what kind of macros the program can handle'
}


special Functions(s '<key>': '<special Function>' ):
	Brightness_Up
	Brightness_Down


NOTE: •	Import the following libraries so that the code can run properly:
	(keyboard, pyautogui, winotify, screen_brightness_control)
	you can also convert the .py to .pyw so that it can run directly without any console popups,
	Or, use the .exe file which contains all the necessary dependencies.
	

      •	This program only supports simple macros, the (') would cause issues with the program.
	Also it only supports single line macros, so dont go adding paragraphs and expecting it to work

      •	Dont forget to add START and STOP macros, if you plan on changing the run type (also change the runtype to 1)

      •	You can find all the supported keys/keytypes here:
